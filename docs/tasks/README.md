# Task Breakdowns

This directory contains detailed task checklists for implementing features.

## Purpose

Tasks break down implementation plans into granular, actionable items that can be tracked and completed systematically.

## Task Organization

Each task file corresponds to an implementation plan and includes:

### Categories

- **Database**: Schema changes, migrations
- **Backend**: API endpoints, business logic
- **Frontend**: Components, pages, hooks
- **AI Integration**: Model loading, prompts, API calls
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E tests
- **Documentation**: API docs, component docs, guides

## Active Task Lists

| ID | Feature | Progress |
|----|---------|----------|
| 001 | Backend Foundation | ✅ 100% |
| 002 | Database Setup | ⏳ 0% |
| 003 | Authentication | 📋 Not Started |

## Task States

- [ ] Not started
- [in progress] Currently working on
- [x] Completed

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic Tasks**: Each task should be completable in <2 hours
2. **Clear Acceptance**: Each task has clear completion criteria
3. **Dependency Order**: Tasks ordered by dependencies
4. **Regular Updates**: Mark tasks complete as you finish them
5. **Blocker Tracking**: Note blockers and dependencies

## Template

See `template.md` for creating new task lists.
